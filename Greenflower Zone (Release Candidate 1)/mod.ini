Description="A port of the Version 2.2 revision of Greenflower Zone from Sonic Robo Blast 2 to Sonic '06, replacing the Kingdom Valley level slot. Using the DLC system also allows the use of all the Amigo Characters.\n\nInitially created to learn Sonic '06 modding back in May of 2019. This project became a small testing ground of sorts for me to experiment on '06 with, before Act 1 finally saw the light of day in March of 2020.\n\nVersion 1.1 brings in Act 2, as well as refines a couple of things from the Version 1.0/1.01 release.\nVersion 1.2 fixes up a few things (most of which were already implemented in hotfixes to Version 1.1) while also slipping in something extra for blue kleptomaniacs)."
